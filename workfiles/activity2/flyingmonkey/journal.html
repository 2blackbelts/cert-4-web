		<strong>Footy Friday - 5th September 2014</strong><br /><br />
		Having recharged my batteries (hmmm... do I have any?), it was time for me to head to TAFE.
		What better time than <a href="http://www.footycoloursday.com.au/">Footy Colours</a> Friday!  <br /><br /> 
		I came in to see Alison, but alas, I just missed her.  
		Feeling bitterly disappointed, I decided it was time for a holiday. Up, up and away...

		<strong>Thursday 18th September 2014</strong><br />
		Can you believe it? I started to get homesick, so I flew back to 
		<a href="http://www.visitbrokenhill.com.au/">Broken Hill.</a> 
		I heard on the grapevine that Alison was going to a training course today. Perfect opportunity to
		catch up at last, so I headed up to the training room. Ah, you wouldn't credit it... when I got there,
		Alison had already left.  
		I've decided to resume my holiday... there are so many exciting places to see in Australia...
		my next stop is Gravelly Beach in Tasmania.
		<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
		<strong>Tuesday 14th July 2015</strong><br />
		How exciting!  Today I arrived in Paris, just in time for the French national day - Bastille Day - or Le quatorze juillet
		as the French usually call it.  After several months exploring Australia I decided it was time to head overseas.
