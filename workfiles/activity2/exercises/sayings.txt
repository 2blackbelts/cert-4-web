Home is where you hang your @
A journey of a thousand sites begins with a single click
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
The E-mail of the species is more deadly than the mail.
You can’t teach a new mouse old clicks.
Speak softly and carry a mobile phone.
Too many clicks spoil the browse.
The geek shall inherit the earth.
A chat has nine lives.
Don’t byte off more than you can view.
What boots up must come down.
Windows will never cease.
Virtual reality is its own reward.
Modulation in all things.
A user and his leisure time are soon parted.
Oh, what a tangled website we weave when first we practice.
Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach him to use the internet and he won’t bother you for weeks.

And finally...
Computers are useless.  They can only give you answers. (Pablo Picasso)
